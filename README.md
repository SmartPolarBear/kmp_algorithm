KMP Algorithm
KMP is a famous algorithm for string pattern matching

This repository contains the implementation of KMP with DFA and NFA (or partial matching table) in **kmp.cpp**.

This repository also contains an implementation in **kmp_with_errors.cpp** that will match strings that has given number of errors.

/doc directory contains the report for the data structure course on this algorithm.
